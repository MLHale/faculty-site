<h3 class="main-heading">About me</h3>
<p>Dr. Matthew Hale is an Assistant Professor of Cybersecurity at the University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO) in the School of Interdisciplinary Informatics, College of Information Science and Technology. Dr. Hale received his PhD from the University of Tulsa (TU) where he worked with the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) on the creation of formal certification tools to provide information assurance capabilities to cloud-based information systems in a way that spans federal government and private regulatory documents. This work produced a formal verification language called Cloud X-UNITY and an interchangeable WS* compliant XML Schema for Security SLA specification called SecAgreement. <br>
<br>
His current research interests lie at the intersection of security and software engineering with specific focuses on building and testing secure web services, mobile applications, and wearables. Since joining UNO in 2014, Dr. Hale has won several competitive research grants (NRI, NSF, etc) to investigate attack vectors in hybrid mobile applications, identify and mitigate consumer wearable security issues in the internet of things, and conduct cybersecurity STEM outreach events. <br>
<br>
In his spare time, Dr. Hale enjoys a love of cooking, – which he thinks isn't all that different from software engineering (e.g. components, connectors, and patterns) – disc golfing, and playing/dungeon mastering D&amp;D.</p>
